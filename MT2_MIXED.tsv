In addition, host NCAM1 can also be used as entry receptor (By similarity). Interaction with host HSPA5 plays an important role in the early stages of infection as well (By similarity). Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and forms a heterodimer with protein prM. The heterodimer plays a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimers between precursor prM and envelope protein E.

Antagonizes also the host MDA5-mediated induction of alpha/beta interferon antiviral response (By similarity).

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction (By similarity). Inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR) in the infected cell by blocking stress granules assembly (PubMed:28592527). Disrupts host centrosome organization in a CEP63-dependent manner to degrade host TBK1 and inhibits innate immune response (PubMed:35793002). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28592527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35793002}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity (By similarity). NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding (By similarity). Cooperatively with NS4B suppresses the Akt-mTOR pathway and leads to cellular dysregulation (PubMed:27524440). By inhibiting host ANKLE2 functions, may cause defects in brain development, such as microcephaly (PubMed:30550790). Also antagonizes the host MDA5-mediated induction of alpha/beta interferon antiviral response (By similarity). Inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR) in the infected cell by blocking stress granules assembly (PubMed:28592527). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27524440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28592527, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30550790}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place (By similarity). Also plays a role in the inhibition of host RLR-induced interferon-beta production at TANK-binding kinase 1/TBK1 level (By similarity). Cooperatively with NS4A suppresses the Akt-mTOR pathway and leads to cellular dysregulation (PubMed:27524440). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27524440}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm (PubMed:30951555). Methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Once sufficient NS5 is expressed, binds to the cap-proximal structure and inhibits further translation of the viral genome (By similarity). Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of a cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Mechanistically, interferes with host kinases TBK1 and IKKE upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3/IRF3 to inhibit the RIG-I pathway (By similarity). Also antagonizes type I interferon signaling by targeting STAT2 for degradation by the proteasome thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway (By similarity). Mechanistically, acts as a scaffold protein to connect host ZSWIM8/CUL3 ligase complex and STAT2, leading to STAT2 degradation. Within the host nucleus, disrupts host SUMO1 and STAT2 co-localization with PML, resulting in PML degradation (PubMed:32699085). May also reduce immune responses by preventing the recruitment of the host PAF1 complex to interferon-responsive genes (PubMed:30550790). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30550790, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30951555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32699085}.

Inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR) in the infected cell (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0A024B7W1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place (By similarity). Also plays a role in the inhibition of host RLR-induced interferon-beta production at TANK-binding kinase 1/TBK1 level (By similarity). Cooperatively with NS4A suppresses the Akt-mTOR pathway and leads to cellular dysregulation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm (By similarity). Methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Once sufficient NS5 is expressed, binds to the cap-proximal structure and inhibits further translation of the viral genome (By similarity). Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of a cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Mechanistically, interferes with host kinases TBK1 and IKKE upstream of interferon regulatory factor 3/IRF3 to inhibit the RIG-I pathway (By similarity). Also antagonizes type I interferon signaling by targeting STAT2 for degradation by the proteasome thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway (By similarity). Mechanistically, acts as a scaffold protein to connect host ZSWIM8/CUL3 ligase complex and STAT2, leading to STAT2 degradation. Within the host nucleus, disrupts host SUMO1 and STAT2 co-localization with PML, resulting in PML degradation (By similarity). May also reduce immune responses by preventing the recruitment of the host PAF1 complex to interferon-responsive genes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0A024B7W1, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q32ZE1}.

Has affinity for ssRNA but not for dsRNA. Capping activity is non-specific and caps RNAs that initiate with either a G or an A residue. Together with VP1 polymerase, forms a VP1-VP3 complex positioned near the channels situated at each of the five-fold vertices of the core. Following infection, the outermost layer of the virus is lost, leaving a double-layered particle (DLP) made up of the core and VP6 shell. VP1 then catalyzes the transcription of fully conservative plus-strand genomic RNAs that are capped by VP3 and extruded through the DLP's channels into the cytoplasm where they function as mRNAs for translation of viral proteins.

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0.

These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 2A]: Component of the viral RNA replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease subunit NS2B]: Required cofactor for the serine protease function of NS3.

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. Also plays a role in virus assembly (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions (By similarity). Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. IFN-I induces binding of NS5 to host IFN-activated transcription factor STAT2, preventing its transcriptional activity. Host TRIM23 is the E3 ligase that interacts with and polyubiquitinates NS5 to promote its binding to STAT2 and trigger IFN-I signaling inhibition. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.	MIXED

The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. Needs as cofactors the phosphoprotein for processivity and the M2-1 anti-termination protein. Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (By similarity). Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation (By similarity). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals. The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28887}.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes (PubMed:2844966). The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) (PubMed:31914397). L is packaged into virions during assembly and translocates to the 3' leader promoter to initiate transcription after entering the host cells (PubMed:35476516). During transcription and replication of the genome, L does not bind the N-RNA complex directly, but is bridged by its non-catalytic cofactor P, which interacts with L and N oligomers simultaneously (PubMed:35476516). In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome (By similarity). The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed (Probable). The viral phosphoprotein helps the polymerase to engage the N-RNA template and acts as a processivity factor (PubMed:22246179, PubMed:22908284). Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (PubMed:19710136).

In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals (By similarity).

The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Mediates complement activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the vascular leakage that occurs in severe dengue disease. Activates autophagy through the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, acts as the assembly platform for STK11-AMPK interactions and promotes STK11-AMPK interactions. In turn, promotes phosphorylation of the AMPK kinase structural domain and activates AMPK, thereby positively regulating the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing autophagy. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29990}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. NS1 induces expression of sialidases, heparanase, and activates cathepsin L, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. These effects are probably linked to the endothelial hyperpermeability observed in severe dengue disease. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 2A]: Component of the viral RNA replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease subunit NS2B]: Required cofactor for the serine protease function of NS3. May have membrane-destabilizing activity and form viroporins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00859}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease NS3]: Displays three enzymatic activities: serine protease, NTPase and RNA helicase. NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Inhibits host TYK2 and STAT2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway (By similarity). May reduce immune responses by preventing the recruitment of the host PAF1 complex to interferon-responsive genes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29990}.	MIXED

These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells.

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction (By similarity). NS3 supports the separation of RNA daughter and template strands during viral replication. The helicase part is involved in the inhibition of phosphorylation of host STAT1, and thereby inhibition of host type-I IFN signaling (By similarity). In addition, NS3 assists the initiation of replication by unwinding the RNA secondary structure in the 3' non-translated region (NTR). Inhibits STAT2 translocation in the nucleus after IFN-alpha treatment (PubMed:15650219). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15650219}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity (By similarity). NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding (By similarity).

NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions (By similarity). Besides its role in genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway (PubMed:15650160, PubMed:20106931). Inhibits host JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PubMed:15650160).

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. Overcomes the anti-viral effects of host EXOC1 by sequestering and degrading the latter through the proteasome degradation pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0. After virion release in extracellular space, gets dissociated from E dimers. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Protein prM]: Acts as a chaperone for envelope protein E during intracellular virion assembly by masking and inactivating envelope protein E fusion peptide. prM is the only viral peptide matured by host furin in the trans-Golgi network probably to avoid catastrophic activation of the viral fusion activity in acidic Golgi compartment prior to virion release. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Mediates complement activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the vascular leakage that occurs in severe dengue disease. Activates autophagy through the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, acts as the assembly platform for STK11-AMPK interactions and promotes STK11-AMPK interactions. In turn, promotes phosphorylation of the AMPK kinase structural domain and activates AMPK, thereby positively regulating the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing autophagy. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29990}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. NS1 induces expression of sialidases, heparanase, and activates cathepsin L, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage.

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place.

Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Inhibits host TYK2 and STAT2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway (By similarity). May reduce immune responses by preventing the recruitment of the host PAF1 complex to interferon-responsive genes (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29990}.	MIXED

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). L is packaged into virions during assembly and translocates to the 3' leader promoter to initiate transcription after entering the host cells. During transcription and replication of the genome, L does not bind the N-RNA complex directly, but is bridged by its non-catalytic cofactor P, which interacts with L and N oligomers simultaneously (By similarity). In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome (By similarity). The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed (By similarity). The viral phosphoprotein helps the polymerase to engage the N-RNA template and acts as a processivity factor.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes (PubMed:8794332). The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) (Probable). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at two different sites in the 3' leader promoter thereby initiating either genome replication or mRNA transcription (PubMed:29873775). In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals (PubMed:8794332). Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome (Probable). The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed (Probable). Needs as cofactors the phosphoprotein for processivity and the M2-1 anti-termination protein (PubMed:31495574, PubMed:8552680). Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (PubMed:16189012, PubMed:8445369). Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation (PubMed:33956914). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals (PubMed:15681446). The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (PubMed:15681446). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15681446, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16189012, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25010481, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29873775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31495574, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8445369, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8552680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8794332, ECO:0000305, ECO:0000305|PubMed:1404620}.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at two different sites in the 3' leader promoter thereby initiating either genome replication or mRNA transcription. In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. Needs as cofactors the phosphoprotein for processivity and the M2-1 anti-termination protein. Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (By similarity). Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation (By similarity). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals. The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28887}.

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. Overcomes the anti-viral effects of host EXOC1 by sequestering and degrading the latter through the proteasome degradation pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0. After virion release in extracellular space, gets dissociated from E dimers. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Protein prM]: Acts as a chaperone for envelope protein E during intracellular virion assembly by masking and inactivating envelope protein E fusion peptide. prM is the only viral peptide matured by host furin in the trans-Golgi network probably to avoid catastrophic activation of the viral fusion activity in acidic Golgi compartment prior to virion release. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured.

NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place.

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. Overcomes the anti-viral effects of host EXOC1 by sequestering and degrading the latter through the proteasome degradation pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0. After virion release in extracellular space, gets dissociated from E dimers. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Protein prM]: Acts as a chaperone for envelope protein E during intracellular virion assembly by masking and inactivating envelope protein E fusion peptide. prM is the only viral peptide matured by host furin in the trans-Golgi network probably to avoid catastrophic activation of the viral fusion activity in acidic Golgi compartment prior to virion release. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. NS1 induces expression of sialidases, heparanase, and activates cathepsin L, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. These effects are probably linked to the endothelial hyperpermeability observed in severe dengue disease. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 2A]: Component of the viral RNA replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease subunit NS2B]: Required cofactor for the serine protease function of NS3.

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Inhibits host TYK2 and STAT2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.	MIXED

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA.

Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. IFN-I induces binding of NS5 to host IFN-activated transcription factor STAT2, preventing its transcriptional activity.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at two different sites in the 3' leader promoter thereby initiating either genome replication or mRNA transcription. In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. Needs as cofactors the phosphoprotein for processivity and the M2-1 anti-termination protein. Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (By similarity). Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation (By similarity). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals. The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28887}.

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. Overcomes the anti-viral effects of host EXOC1 by sequestering and degrading the latter through the proteasome degradation pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0. After virion release in extracellular space, gets dissociated from E dimers. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Protein prM]: Acts as a chaperone for envelope protein E during intracellular virion assembly by masking and inactivating envelope protein E fusion peptide. prM is the only viral peptide matured by host furin in the trans-Golgi network probably to avoid catastrophic activation of the viral fusion activity in acidic Golgi compartment prior to virion release. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. NS1 induces expression of sialidases, heparanase, and activates cathepsin L, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. These effects are probably linked to the endothelial hyperpermeability observed in severe dengue disease. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 2A]: Component of the viral RNA replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease subunit NS2B]: Required cofactor for the serine protease function of NS3. May have membrane-destabilizing activity and form viroporins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00859}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease NS3]: Displays three enzymatic activities: serine protease, NTPase and RNA helicase. NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Inhibits host TYK2 and STAT2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.	MIXED

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0.

They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured.

NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. Inhibits STAT2 translocation in the nucleus after IFN-alpha treatment. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). L is packaged into virions during assembly and translocates to the 3' leader promoter to initiate transcription after entering the host cells. During transcription and replication of the genome, L does not bind the N-RNA complex directly, but is bridged by its non-catalytic cofactor P, which interacts with L and N oligomers simultaneously (By similarity). In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome (By similarity).

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA.

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). L is packaged into virions during assembly and translocates to the 3' leader promoter to initiate transcription after entering the host cells. During transcription and replication of the genome, L does not bind the N-RNA complex directly, but is bridged by its non-catalytic cofactor P, which interacts with L and N oligomers simultaneously (By similarity). In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome (By similarity). The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed (By similarity). The viral phosphoprotein helps the polymerase to engage the N-RNA template and acts as a processivity factor. Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase (By similarity). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals (By similarity). The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28887}.

During virus entry, may induce genome penetration into the host cytoplasm after hemifusion induced by the surface proteins. Can migrate to the cell nucleus where it modulates host functions. Overcomes the anti-viral effects of host EXOC1 by sequestering and degrading the latter through the proteasome degradation pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Capsid protein C]: Inhibits RNA silencing by interfering with host Dicer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide pr]: Prevents premature fusion activity of envelope proteins in trans-Golgi by binding to envelope protein E at pH6.0. After virion release in extracellular space, gets dissociated from E dimers. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Protein prM]: Acts as a chaperone for envelope protein E during intracellular virion assembly by masking and inactivating envelope protein E fusion peptide. prM is the only viral peptide matured by host furin in the trans-Golgi network probably to avoid catastrophic activation of the viral fusion activity in acidic Golgi compartment prior to virion release. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Small envelope protein M]: May play a role in virus budding. Exerts cytotoxic effects by activating a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through M ectodomain. May display a viroporin activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Envelope protein E]: Binds to host cell surface receptor and mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured. These uncleaved prM would play a role in immune evasion. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Involved in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. Once cleaved off the polyprotein, is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication cycle, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. Essential for viral replication. Required for formation of the replication complex and recruitment of other non-structural proteins to the ER-derived membrane structures. Excreted as a hexameric lipoparticle that plays a role against host immune response. Antagonizing the complement function. Binds to the host macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. NS1 induces expression of sialidases, heparanase, and activates cathepsin L, which activates heparanase via enzymatic cleavage. These effects are probably linked to the endothelial hyperpermeability observed in severe dengue disease. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 2A]: Component of the viral RNA replication complex that functions in virion assembly and antagonizes the host immune response. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease subunit NS2B]: Required cofactor for the serine protease function of NS3. May have membrane-destabilizing activity and form viroporins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00859}.; FUNCTION: [Serine protease NS3]: Displays three enzymatic activities: serine protease, NTPase and RNA helicase. NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. Plays a role in the inhibition of the host innate immune response. Interacts with host MAVS and thereby prevents the interaction between RIGI and MAVS. In turn, IFN-beta production is impaired. Interacts with host AUP1 which mediates induction of lipophagy in host cells and facilitates production of virus progeny particles (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29991, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions. Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. Inhibits host TYK2 and STAT2 phosphorylation, thereby preventing activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.	MIXED

Also performs the polyadenylation of subgenomic mRNAs by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end of viral genes. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at two different sites in the 3' leader promoter thereby initiating either genome replication or mRNA transcription. In the transcription mode, the polymerase performs the sequential transcription of all mRNAs using a termination-reinitiation mechanism responding to gene start and gene end signals. Some polymerase disengage from the template at each gene junction, resulting in a decreasing abundance of transcripts from the 3' to the 5' end of the genome. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. Needs as cofactors the phosphoprotein for processivity and the M2-1 anti-termination protein. Polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides (By similarity). Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation (By similarity). In the replication mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing the gene end transcriptional signals. The ability of the polymerase to override the gene end signals as it is producing the antigenome is probably due to replicative RNA becoming encapsidated with nucleoprotein as it is synthesized (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P28887}.

Envelope protein is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of heterodimer with protein prM. They play a role in virion budding in the ER, and the newly formed immature particle is covered with 60 spikes composed of heterodimer between precursor prM and envelope protein E. The virion is transported to the Golgi apparatus where the low pH causes dissociation of PrM-E heterodimers and formation of E homodimers. prM-E cleavage is inefficient, and many virions are only partially matured.

Inhibits signal transduction originating from Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Mediates complement activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the vascular leakage that occurs in severe dengue disease. Activates autophagy through the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, acts as the assembly platform for STK11-AMPK interactions and promotes STK11-AMPK interactions. In turn, promotes phosphorylation of the AMPK kinase structural domain and activates AMPK, thereby positively regulating the AMPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing autophagy. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P29990}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 1]: Disrupts the host endothelial glycocalyx layer of host pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, inducing degradation of sialic acid and shedding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

NS3 serine protease, in association with NS2B, performs its autocleavage and cleaves the polyprotein at dibasic sites in the cytoplasm: C-prM, NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A, NS4A-2K and NS4B-NS5. NS3 RNA helicase binds RNA and unwinds dsRNA in the 3' to 5' direction. Also plays a role in virus assembly (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314, ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00860}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4A]: Regulates the ATPase activity of the NS3 helicase activity. NS4A allows NS3 helicase to conserve energy during unwinding. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [Peptide 2k]: Functions as a signal peptide for NS4B and is required for the interferon antagonism activity of the latter. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P17763}.; FUNCTION: [Non-structural protein 4B]: Induces the formation of ER-derived membrane vesicles where the viral replication takes place. Inhibits interferon (IFN)-induced host STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, thereby preventing the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the IFN-alpha/beta pathway. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Q6P4}.; FUNCTION: [RNA-directed RNA polymerase NS5]: Replicates the viral (+) and (-) RNA genome, and performs the capping of genomes in the cytoplasm. NS5 methylates viral RNA cap at guanine N-7 and ribose 2'-O positions (By similarity). Besides its role in RNA genome replication, also prevents the establishment of cellular antiviral state by blocking the interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling pathway. IFN-I induces binding of NS5 to host IFN-activated transcription factor STAT2, preventing its transcriptional activity. Host TRIM23 is the E3 ligase that interacts with and polyubiquitinates NS5 to promote its binding to STAT2 and trigger IFN-I signaling inhibition. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03314}.	MIXED

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

Catalyzes the formation of the 5' cap structure on the viral plus-strand transcripts. Specifically binds to GTP and displays guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities. Has affinity for ssRNA but not for dsRNA. Capping activity is non-specific and caps RNAs that initiate with either a G or an A residue. Together with VP1 polymerase, forms a VP1-VP3 complex positioned near the channels situated at each of the five-fold vertices of the core. Following infection, the outermost layer of the virus is lost, leaving a double-layered particle (DLP) made up of the core and VP6 shell. VP1 then catalyzes the transcription of fully conservative plus-strand genomic RNAs that are capped by VP3 and extruded through the DLP's channels into the cytoplasm where they function as mRNAs for translation of viral proteins. DLPs probably have an RNA triphosphatase activity as well, whereas open cores do not. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04128}.; FUNCTION: Counteracts the host innate immune response thanks to its phosphodiesterase that degrades the 5'-triphosphorylated, 2'-5' linked adenylate oligomers produced by the host cell IFN-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS).

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration.

Together with VP1 polymerase, forms a VP1-VP3 complex positioned near the channels situated at each of the five-fold vertices of the core. Following infection, the outermost layer of the virus is lost, leaving a double-layered particle (DLP) made up of the core and VP6 shell. VP1 then catalyzes the transcription of fully conservative plus-strand genomic RNAs that are capped by VP3 and extruded through the DLP's channels into the cytoplasm where they function as mRNAs for translation of viral proteins.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

Catalyzes the formation of the 5' cap structure on the viral plus-strand transcripts (By similarity). Specifically binds to GTP and displays guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities (By similarity). Has affinity for ssRNA but not for dsRNA (By similarity). Capping activity is non-specific and caps RNAs that initiate with either a G or an A residue (By similarity). Together with VP1 polymerase, forms a VP1-VP3 complex positioned near the channels situated at each of the five-fold vertices of the core (PubMed:20122940). Following infection, the outermost layer of the virus is lost, leaving a double-layered particle (DLP) made up of the core and VP6 shell (By similarity). VP1 then catalyzes the transcription of fully conservative plus-strand genomic RNAs that are capped by VP3 and extruded through the DLP's channels into the cytoplasm where they function as mRNAs for translation of viral proteins (By similarity). DLPs probably have an RNA triphosphatase activity as well, whereas open cores do not (By similarity). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04128, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20122940}.; FUNCTION: Counteracts the host innate immune response thanks to its phosphodiesterase that degrades the 5'-triphosphorylated, 2'-5' linked adenylate oligomers produced by the host cell IFN-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS).

The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration. In this mode, the polymerase replicates the whole viral genome without recognizing transcriptional signals, and the replicated genome is not caped or polyadenylated. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.

The viral polymerase binds to the genomic RNA at the 3' leader promoter, and transcribes subsequently all viral mRNAs with a decreasing efficiency. The first gene is the most transcribed, and the last the least transcribed. The viral phosphoprotein acts as a processivity factor. Capping is concomitant with initiation of mRNA transcription. Indeed, a GDP polyribonucleotidyl transferase (PRNTase) adds the cap structure when the nascent RNA chain length has reached few nucleotides. Ribose 2'-O methylation of viral mRNA cap precedes and facilitates subsequent guanine-N-7 methylation, both activities being carried by the viral polymerase. Polyadenylation of mRNAs occur by a stuttering mechanism at a slipery stop site present at the end viral genes. After finishing transcription of a mRNA, the polymerase can resume transcription of the downstream gene. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P03523}.; FUNCTION: RNA-directed RNA polymerase that catalyzes the replication of viral genomic RNA. The template is composed of the viral RNA tightly encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). The replicase mode is dependent on intracellular N protein concentration.

Catalyzes the formation of the 5' cap structure on the viral plus-strand transcripts. Specifically binds to GTP and displays guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities. Has affinity for ssRNA but not for dsRNA. Capping activity is non-specific and caps RNAs that initiate with either a G or an A residue. Together with VP1 polymerase, forms a VP1-VP3 complex positioned near the channels situated at each of the five-fold vertices of the core. Following infection, the outermost layer of the virus is lost, leaving a double-layered particle (DLP) made up of the core and VP6 shell. VP1 then catalyzes the transcription of fully conservative plus-strand genomic RNAs that are capped by VP3 and extruded through the DLP's channels into the cytoplasm where they function as mRNAs for translation of viral proteins. DLPs probably have an RNA triphosphatase activity as well, whereas open cores do not. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04128}.; FUNCTION: Counteracts the host innate immune response thanks to its phosphodiesterase that degrades the 5'-triphosphorylated, 2'-5' linked adenylate oligomers produced by the host cell IFN-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS).
